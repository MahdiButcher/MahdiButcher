## 👑 **What I'm Working On**  

Here’s the stuff that’s keepin’ me busy these days:  

- ⚔️ Building a **proxy management system**—blocking dodgy IPs like a champ.  
- 🤖 Crafting smart **Telegram bots** for handling anything thrown their way.  
- 🛡️ Exploring custom S3 solutions like MinIO. Gotta keep those files safe, yeah?

## 🎯 **What I Believe**  

- 💪 Code should be efficient, not bloated. Don’t waste my bloody time.
